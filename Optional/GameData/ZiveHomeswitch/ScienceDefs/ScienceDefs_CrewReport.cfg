    @RESULTS
    {
        %SunFlyingLow = After a good few seconds of being surprised that I haven't been incinerated yet, I still can't look out the window(s).
        %SunFlyingHigh = For a star that's slightly darker than others, Zivezda is quite painful to look at. Looking out the window(s) is not reccomended.

        %SunInSpaceLow = If I squint really hard I can make out the coronae of Zivezda. Replication of this experiment is not recommended.
        %SunInSpaceHigh = Looking out the window I can see... Slightly orange light.

        VetaroiaFlyingLow = Was it really a good idea to plunge into a burning gas giant?
        VetaroiaFlyingHigh = Maybe entering the atmosphere of a brown dwarf might just be an unwise decision. Who cares! Not a single stupid idea can stop the infinite glory of SCIENCE!

        VetaroiaInSpaceLow = The glowing clouds are really mesmerizing, yet likely very much not fun to be in.
        VetaroiaInSpaceHigh = This brown dwarf will eventually cool down and just be a very closely orbiting gas giant. This might pose a big issue for the climate of most places here as a very small yet just-enough significant heat difference won't be fun.

        TorrisSrfLanded = The view of Zivezda and Vetaroia from here is rather scary, speaking of which, is this planet getting closer to that star?
        TorrisSrfLanded = Something gives off a really unpleasant feeling, I just can't pinpoint what exactly.
        TorrisSrfLanded = Those mountains look very tall...

        TorrisInSpaceLow = The curve of this planet is very prominent from up here.
        TorrisInSpaceHigh = What was that bright blue flash on the surface? Am I losing my mind??

        SeyndSrfLanded = No matter where I look I only see sand!
        SeyndSrfLanded = The thick atmosphere and high gravity is sinking everything into the sand...
        SeyndSrfLanded = Waiting for night has proven to be impossible, unless if I just walk in one direction...

        SeyndFlyingLow = The atmosphere down here is getting quite thick... Are there any plans to get home?
        SeyndFlyingHigh = The ground is so hazy from up here...

        SeyndInSpaceLow = Looking out the window proves that Seynd is indeed very yellow.
        SeyndInSpaceHigh = Seynd vaguely resembles an eyeball, maybe it once had an ocean?

        KrassoniaFlyingLow = It's getting very red down here. Any hope for finding a surface has been lost.
        KrassoniaFlyingHigh = The clouds below prove to be very much red. These clouds are likely made of nitrogen dioxide, but that spawns it's own questions so it's better to not think of it too much.

        KrassoniaInSpaceLow = These swirling bands of gas hide any kind of surface that might be hidden, if there is any, of course.
        KrassoniaInSpaceHigh = This giant red sphere would look incredible from any moons orbiting it...

        DjarkSrfLanded = Looking around proves the existence of giant oceans of lava in the distance, perhaps this moon may not be the best place to live.
        DjarkSrfLanded = The surrounding landscape is very dark, meaning that it's likely made of something dark. What a great observation.
        DjarkSrfLanded = The view of Krassonia from here is truly grandiose.
        DjarkSrfSplashed = Please do not under ANY circumstances swim in these oceans, this is NOT orange juice.
        DjarkSrfSplashed = The air conditioners are running at maximum capacity, this could not possibly by caused by the orange juice oceans...

        DjarkInSpaceLow = The KSC advised not to swim in the orange juice oceans. This would be the second time defying the KSC's orders.
        DjarkInSpaceHigh = The orange juice oceans seem to be peculiarly glowing. Orange juice is not known to glow, must be some very exotic orange juice.

        
        
        %KerbinSrfLanded = I'm frankly amazed by how dry it looks here for a world with so much water around...
        %KerbinSrfLanded = It feels just like home here, except for the giant red circle taking up a quarter of the sky.
        %KerbinSrfLanded = I wonder if I can drink the ocean water, surely it can't be as salty like that on Kerbin!
        %KerbinSrfSplashed = The water here seems to taste very good for seawater, Maybe the oceans here lack salt? Nevertheless this means that surviving here won't be that big of a challenge.
        %KerbinSrfSplashed = The waves seem to be very intense here, would be great if we brought surfboards.
        %KerbinFlyingLow = The grasslands down there look good for picnics, maybe I won't be bullied by mosquitoes this time!
        %KerbinFlyingHigh = I can see lovely beaches from up here, maybe I can go for a swim, oh yeah... I have to land first. How ironic, "landing" just to go swimming, what was our original plan again?

        %KerbinInSpaceLow = What if I'm orbiting Kerbin right now. have I really gone interstellar or am I being lied to..? Oh nevermind, the big red circle over there proves otherwise.
        %KerbinInSpaceHigh = Looking at Vadeonia for a while proves that the continents do indeed vaguely look like a fish.
        
        MkoriaSrfLanded = The green atmosphere and the tall mountains... What was I going to say again?
        MkoriaSrfLanded = This planet's shiny moon, along with orbiting really close is definitely... What was the word, megalophobia inducing..?
        MkoriaSrfLanded = The oceans in the distance look like orange juice...
        MkoriaSrfSplashed = After sneaking a taste of an ocean sample I can definitely conclude that the liquid here tastes like orange juice. I did not check if it's toxic to ingest, oops.
        MkoriaSrfSplashed = Analysis of an ocean sample confirms that it has ethyl butyrate, further testing is required to prove whether or not it tastes like orange juice.

        MkoriaFlyingLow = The atmosphere is rather thin here, seeing the orange-colored oceans below makes me think that the liquids here taste like orange juice, unlike the lava on Djark.
        MkoriaFlyingHigh = The view from up here is pretty cool, I can see tiny continents on the surface, no larger than Kaustralia on Kerbin.

        MkoriaInSpaceLow = Yeah, whoever thought this place looked habitable was absolutely wrong about that, there's no way I'm taking a breath down there.
        MkoriaInSpaceHigh = Seeing this planet from such a distance reminds me of Kerbin, if it was a greenish-yellow color and probably uninhabitable.

        KimaenSrfLanded = The surface here is definitely metallic...
        KimaenSrfLanded = Looking around, I see craters, rocks, and a urine-colored planet in the sky.

        KimaenInSpaceLow = Seeing rocks at the surface, nothing else.
        KimaenInSpaceHigh = This moon looks really shiny from space, it looks like the mun, but shiny.

        SeinaFlyingLow = Maybe it was a bit foolish to think that a blue planet would be like Kerbin...
        SeinaFlyingHigh = The atmosphere is... Quite blue here, further investigation may reveal that it's in fact light blue.

        SeinaInSpaceLow = Being this close to a gas giant isn't exactly the most calming experience.
        SeinaInSpaceHigh = Looking out into the huge rings makes everything else feel quite small...

        PeylSrfLanded = Why exactly did we go here again?
        PeylSrfLanded = The surface is very brown here, as expected.
        PeylSrfLanded = I can see the curvature of this moon from the surface!

        PeylInSpaceLow = This really barely counts as a moon, it just looks like a huge rock! The view from there must be nice though.
        PeylInSpaceHigh = Looking at Peyl... It really looks like a grain of sand from here.

        BleaSrfLanded = It's very icy here.
        BleaSrfLanded = The view of Seina from here is nice...
        BleaSrfLanded = If this moon were to be closer to Zivezda, then maybe it would be a huge ocean. How cool would it be, swimming in low gravity?

        BleaInSpaceLow = Yep, looking down proves that this moon is indeed made of ice.
        BleaInSpaceHigh = Isn't it strange how inclined this moon's orbit is?

        HaleSrfLanded = So... Much... Snow...
        HaleSrfLanded = After careful observation, there seem to be some sort of pine trees here. Breathing here is still not recommended
        HaleSrfLanded = The environment here looks like that of Kerbin's northern regions. The gas giant in the sky reminds me that I'm in fact, not on Kerbin.
        HaleSrfSplashed = These lakes are really unexpected, since they're quite hard to see from space.
        HaleSrfSplashed = This ocean sample vaguely tastes like beer... I thought Hans has never been here before. Does alcohol just naturally exist like that?

        HaleFlyingLow = Are those pine trees?
        HaleFlyingHigh = The atmosphere up here reminds me a lot of Kerbin, likely not breathable.

        HaleInSpaceLow = Finding lakes and rivers here is extremely difficult from space, since not only is the water shiny but also the entire moon.
        HaleInSpaceHigh = This moon looks like a giant snowball.
