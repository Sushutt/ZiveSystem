    {
        TorrisSrfLandedMountains = I've walked here for a bit now, the ground isn't stable.
        TorrisSrfLandedHighlands = I'm standing on a vibrating rock!
        TorrisSrfLandedMidlands = It's getting a bit warm around here...
        TorrisSrfLandedLowlands = I can see that brown dwarf from up here! Now I can't see!

        SeyndSrfLandedGreat_Crater = Observations prove that we are indeed, in a sandy place.
        SeyndSrfLandedMountains = It's so hard to walk here...
        SeyndSrfLandedHighlands = The fact that the snack storage isn't empty shows that this planet indeed has high gravity.
        SeyndSrfLandedMidlands = Am I sinking into the sand?
        SeyndSrfLandedLowlands = I'm walking in a dried up ocean. Wait, did I just say ocean?

        DjarkSrfLandedHighlands = Walking up here proves to be the least precarious.
        DjarkSrfLandedMidlands = It would be awesome, swimming in the lava in the distance. Too bad these spacesuits will melt.
        DjarkSrfLandedLowlands = It would be best to avoid falling over here.
        DjarkSrfSplashed = This is unbelievably dangerous.

        %KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Frolicking through the grass fields of a second Kerbin.
        %KerbinSrfLandedDesert_Highlands = This very much reminds me of walking around in a desert on Kerbin.
        %KerbinSrfLandedDesert_Midlands = Not the first to walk on a desert, but certainly not he first to do it here!
        %KerbinSrfLandedDesert_Lowlands = Still walking in a desert, bit lower than the other desert biomes. 
        %KerbinSrfLandedDesert_Poles = Why go outside here?
        %KerbinSrfSplashed = Swimming here is very fun, especially with the intense waves.

        MkoriaSrfLandedLowlands = It's pretty cool here, you won't see brown beaches anywhere else.
        MkoriaSrfLandedMidlands = The good old sand, oh how I love it!
        MkoriaSrfLandedHighlands = Walking around in some brown sand, incredible.
        MkoriaSrfSplashed = Swimming here is really scary. Are those glowing red eyes down there?

        KimaenSrfLandedDeep_Pits = It's like I'm walking around in a beach made of metal!
        KimaenSrfLandedLowlands = The dust looks like glitter, it's unbelievably fun to kick around.
        KimaenSrfLandedMidlands = The dust here is slightly brighter. It looks like shattered glass!
        KimaenSrfLandedHighlands = Walking around in glitter...
        KimaenSrfLandedMountains = The glitte- I mean dust up here is quite bright. It's getting everywhere!

        PeylSrfLandedLowlands = It's difficult to walk here, except now I can't even stay on the ground!
        PeylSrfLandedMidlands = Walking on a steep hill... I can't even fall here anyways...
        PeylSrfLandedHighlands = The sand up here is very hard to walk on, probably because there's barely any gravity here.

        BleaSrfLandedLowlands = I expected it to be slippery here, but there's no water to slip on!
        BleaSrfLandedMidlands = Would it be cool to ice skate downhill?
        BleaSrfLandedHighlands = Imagine the awesomeness if I ice skated down hill...
        BleaSrfLandedPeaks = Imagine ice skating from all the way up here! What if I launch myself off that hill in the distance?

        HaleSrfLandedLowlands = It's very snowy here, hard to walk.
        HaleSrfLandedHighlands = It's like a snow walk, but all year!
        HaleSrfSplashed = It's very cold here.
