    @RESULTS
    {
        TorrisSrfLandedMountains = There's rocks up here too...
        TorrisSrfLandedHighlands = Yep, these are rocks. Further investigation reveals that these are very warm rocks too!
        TorrisSrfLandedMidlands = These look to be igneous rocks. Maybe there were volcanoes all around this planet long ago...
        TorrisSrfLandedLowlands = Warm rocks! Hooray!

        SeyndSrfLandedGreat_Crater = Digging under the sand doesn't show much, but for some reason I think there used to be an ocean here.
        SeyndSrfLandedMountains = This planet's name really doesn't lie, the whole place is sand!
        SeyndSrfLandedHighlands = Digging beneath the sand reveals regular-looking rocks. Perhaps sand wasn't always here...
        SeyndSrfLandedMidlands = What a crazy desert, it has sand in it!
        SeyndSrfLandedLowlands = There may have been lakes since there's so much sand here. In fact, maybe this planet was a giant ocean that has slowly dried up over time?

        DjarkSrfLandedHighlands = The rocks here seem to be colder than those closer to the lava. Why I'm pointing this out is another question.
        DjarkSrfLandedMidlands = Yeah, igneous rocks, really surprising.
        DjarkSrfLandedLowlands = I regret picking up these rocks, they're very hot.
        DjarkSrfSplashed = It was already risky landing in a lava ocean, and now there's a bucket of lava inside the spacecraft.

        VadeoniaSrfLandedGrasslands = The soil here is barely fertile. The only living grass is growing here, so this is probably the best out there.
        VadeoniaSrfLandedDesert_Highlands = Yeah, it's sand.
        VadeoniaSrfLandedDesert_Midlands = I've already seen so much sand, so this is definitely a change of pace, even more sand!
        VadeoniaSrfLandedDesert_Lowlands = The sand here is wet. I'm suspicious of an ocean being nearby...
        VadeoniaSrfLandedDesert_Poles = Snow, in a cold climate, how surprising!
        VadeoniaSrfSplashed = The water here tastes like tap water.

        MkoriaSrfLandedLowlands = The sand here is wet, not with water.
        MkoriaSrfLandedMidlands = Sand.
        MkoriaSrfLandedHighlands = After careful consideration... I've determined nothing, it's still sand.
        MkoriaSrfSplashed = This ocean is definitely not water.

        KimaenSrfLandedDeep_Pits = The rocks here seem to be recently formed.
        KimaenSrfLandedLowlands = A surface sample reveals very shiny rocks.
        KimaenSrfLandedMidlands = Even here the rocks are shiny, perhaps there's metal in there?
        KimaenSrfLandedHighlands = Yeah, these surface samples have very shiny metals in them.
        KimaenSrfLandedMountains = Even up here the ground has metals!

        PeylSrfLandedLowlands = A sample shows a collection of rocks and dust, it's quite similar to sand.
        PeylSrfLandedMidlands = It's like gravel, just without the weather.
        PeylSrfLandedHighlands = The higher elevation here is like a pile of rocks, except it was collected through Seina's rings.

        BleaSrfLandedLowlands = It's safe to conclude that the sample taken is made of ice.
        BleaSrfLandedMidlands = The ice here seems to be a bit packed.
        BleaSrfLandedHighlands = Solid ice, that's what it is.
        BleaSrfLandedPeaks = Higher elevation ice seems to be no different from the rest.

        HaleSrfLandedLowlands = The sample shows a slight hint of... Fertile soil???
        HaleSrfLandedHighlands = This is the best kind of snow! Let's build a snowman!
        HaleSrfSplashed = This water is extremely salty...
